#Creating New Address List Category in Office 365 Cloud Environment
Pre-Requisites: Name & DisplayName,List of targeted recipients,RecipientFilterQuery.
Note: Once the Recipient Filter Query is ready, Test it with "Get-Recipient" Command to valid the Query before creating the Address list. Also, Once the New Address list has been created, we need to run "Set-Mailbox" Command with "ApplyMandatoryProperties"  for each of targeted mailbox to make it visible in new address list category.
After ran the below commands,Our New Address list category is ready to use in the next few minutes.

Get-Recipient -Filter '((Alias -ne $null) -and (CustomAttribute8 -eq "Microsoft_Teams_Room"))'
New-AddressList -Name "Microsoft Teams Rooms" -DisplayName "Microsoft Teams Rooms" -RecipientFilter '((Alias -ne $null) -and (CustomAttribute8 -eq "Microsoft_Teams_Room"))â€™
Set-Mailbox "IN-BLR-ECity-fourth Floor" -ApplyMandatoryProperties

====================================================================================================================================================================
#Updating the Recipeint Filter Query of the address list(If-Required)

Set-AddressList "Microsoft Teams Rooms" -RecipientFilter '((Alias -ne $null) -and (CustomAttribute9 -eq "Microsoft_Teams_Room"))'

====================================================================================================================================================================

#Verification of Address list members against the Recipient filter Query
Logic: Compare the O/P of "Get-Recipient" along with the Filter Query Vs AddressList Membership

Get-Recipient -Filter '((Alias -ne $null) -and (CustomAttribute8 -eq "Microsoft_Teams_Room"))'	
Get-recipient -filter $a.recipientfilter

#Get the Distinguisedname of the New Address List using "Get-AddressList" Command.
Get-Recipient -Filter {AddressListMembership -eq 'CN=BLR Rooms,CN=All Address Lists,CN=Address Lists Container,CN=Configuration,CN=developersk.onmicrosoft.com,CN=ConfigurationUnits,DC=INDPR01A009,DC=PROD,DC=OUTLOOK,DC=COM'}

Output of two above results should be the same. If not ran the "Set-Mailbox" Command with "ApplyMandatoryProperties" against the not listed recipients.
